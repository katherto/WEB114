                    I found Loki's profile online at PetFinder.com.
                    He was classified as a feral kitten since he was very shy and never approached people, keeping to himself.
                    A farmer in Emporia, Kansas trapped him and took him to a local shelter.
                    They had him for about a month before I adopted him.
                    It took about three days before Loki stopped hiding all the time at home and began to approach me.
                    Loki is the first pet I've had for myself and he's quite the handful!
                    He's always energetic and constantly wants to play, running around and playing fetch with the toy balls I've bought him.</span>
